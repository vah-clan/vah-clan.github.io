In the "Players" section, we now have a "White List", "Gray List" and "Black
List". Players in the white list are confirmed active players, players in the
gray list are to be confirmed active players and the black list contains
inactive players or those that have left the clan.

We are currently going through our active players, making sure that we remain
one of the largest active clans. It would be useful if everybody who is an
active player shared their contact details in the "Register" section in the
"About".
