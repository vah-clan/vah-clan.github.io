# New Site

*By |VAH|-B[]*

We created a new site!

## Why?

The previous site was heavy and difficult to maintain, despite not running any
Javascript and being relatively simple. This is because of several reasons:

* All the resources were loaded into a single page (tiles) and had to be loaded
each time.
* Everything was coded in raw `HTML`, making the site easy to break and
difficult to modify.
* Tiles didn't work well on all devices and didn't look as sleek as intended -
a simpler design seems to be more widely preferred.

## New Features

There are several new features which are exciting:

* The entire site is built from a series of markdown (`.md`) files, meaning
they are easier to edit and reason about and capture the content in a raw,
future proof format.
* We now offer an RSS feed for blog content meaning that you can integrate this
into your feeds.
* Content now makes use of the full browser space on offer.
* Website is simpler and more compatible with a wider ranger of browsers. This
has been tested with `lynx` (a simple text-based browser).

And we're also glad to announce that we still run no Javascript!

## Future

In the future we hope to slowly implement more features, such as:

* Allow clan members to create blog posts.
* Allow clan members and public to comment on posts.
* Allow clan members to upload images and videos of games.

Currently these things are done manually, automating them will make make
everything easier! :)
