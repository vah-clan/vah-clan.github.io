# New Clan Page

*By |VAH|-B[]*

Due to some issues regarding servers, we have migrated to this page, kindly
hosted for free by GitHub. We have gone with a single page format for
simplicity and have chosen not to run JavaScript to improve our
members/visitors privacy. The bandwidth required to view our page should be
low, although third party resources may take some time.

Thank you for your patience with us as we redesign our site and perform clan
admin.
