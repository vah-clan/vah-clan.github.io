# About

## Who?

We are a clan that spans the entire world, with many nationalities and varying
skill. The one common factor within our clan is that we like the Assault Cube
game and playing with friendly people. See the "Active Players" section for
more details.

## Why?

Our goal is to maintain one of the largest, active, friendliest clans on
Assault Cube. We do not charge for registration like some other clans and we
aim to respect the privacy of our members.

## Donations

We are currently not accepting donations, but this is likely to change in the
near future. Please use the "Contact" section for more information regarding
this matter.

In the future, we will likely be looking for:

* Private servers to host games and IRC
* Domain name
* Developer time
