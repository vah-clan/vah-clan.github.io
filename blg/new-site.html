<h1 id="new-site">New Site</h1>
<p><em>By |VAH|-B[]</em></p>
<p>We created a new site!</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The previous site was heavy and difficult to maintain, despite not running any Javascript and being relatively simple. This is because of several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the resources were loaded into a single page (tiles) and had to be loaded each time.</li>
<li>Everything was coded in raw <code>HTML</code>, making the site easy to break and difficult to modify.</li>
<li>Tiles didn't work well on all devices and didn't look as sleek as intended - a simpler design seems to be more widely preferred.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<p>There are several new features which are exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire site is built from a series of markdown (<code>.md</code>) files, meaning they are easier to edit and reason about and capture the content in a raw, future proof format.</li>
<li>We now offer an RSS feed for blog content meaning that you can integrate this into your feeds.</li>
<li>Content now makes use of the full browser space on offer.</li>
<li>Website is simpler and more compatible with a wider ranger of browsers. This has been tested with <code>lynx</code> (a simple text-based browser).</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're also glad to announce that we still run no Javascript!</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>In the future we hope to slowly implement more features, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow clan members to create blog posts.</li>
<li>Allow clan members and public to comment on posts.</li>
<li>Allow clan members to upload images and videos of games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently these things are done manually, automating them will make make everything easier! :)</p>
