    We have decided to move some of our VAH servers to TM's master server in
    order to encourage diversity within the game in light of some recent
    conversations. Servers 3 and 4 have been moved, with servers 1 and 2
    remaining on the master server.

    here</a> regarding the reasons behind the move, as well as opinions of
    others in the AC community.

    To change your script to start on TM's server, please change your script
    from:
    <pre>
      CUBE_OPTIONS="--home=${HOME}/.assaultcube_v1.2 --init -m164.132.110.143"
    </pre>
    To:
    <pre>
      CUBE_OPTIONS="--home=${HOME}/.assaultcube_v1.2 --init -m164.132.110.143 \
      --masterport=28760 --mastertype=0"
    </pre>
    It is easier if you have two scripts. This of course will look slightly
    different depending on which OS you run, the above is for Linux. You will
    have to find the equivalent for your OS, or use the
